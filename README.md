Cordova Registry
================

This repo contains a couchapp that allows `plugman` to interact with the cordova registy databases. This was taken from npmjs since plugman relies on npmjs. 

For deploying this locally or remotely, please follow the [cordova-registy-web readme](https://github.com/apache/cordova-registry-web/blob/master/README.md).
