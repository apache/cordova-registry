This repo contains a couchapp that allows `plugman` and `npm` to interact with the cordova registy databases. These files were copied from [npmjs](https://github.com/npm/npmjs.org/tree/master/registry) since `plugman` relies on `npm`.

For deploying this locally or remotely, please follow the [cordova-registy-web readme](https://github.com/apache/cordova-registry-web/blob/refactor/README.md).
